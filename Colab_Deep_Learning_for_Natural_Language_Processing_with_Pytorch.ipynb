It assumes working knowledge of core NLP problems: part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, etc.  It also assumes familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book).  Usually, these courses cover the basic backpropagation algorithm on feed-forward neural networks, and make the point that they are chains of compositions of linearities and non-linearities.  This tutorial aims to get you started writing deep learning code, given you have this prerequisite knowledge.\n",

Well, since our loss is an autograd.Variable, we can compute gradients with respect to all of the parameters used to compute it!  Then we can perform standard gradient updates.  Let $\\theta$ be our parameters, $L(\\theta)$ the loss function, and $\\eta$ a positive learning rate.  Then:\n",

        "There are a huge collection of algorithms and active research in attempting to do something more than just this vanilla gradient update.  Many attempt to vary the learning rate based on what is happening at train time.  You don't need to worry about what specifically these algorithms are doing unless you are really interested.  Torch provies many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely transparent.  Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more complicated algorithms.  Trying different update algorithms and different parameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning rates) is important in optimizing your network's performance.  Often, just replacing vanilla SGD with an optimizer like Adam or RMSProp will boost performance noticably."

What we need to do is to multiply the potentials, which corresponds to adding log potentials.  Then, we have to sum over tags, but what is the corresponding operation to summing over tags in log space?  It is not clear.  Instead, we need to transform out of log-space, take the product of potentials, do the sum over tags, and then transform back to log space.  This is broken down in the revised recurrence below:\n",

If you understand what is going on, you'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the forward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation.
